# GNOme Browsers

## [GNOme Structure Browser](https://raw.githack.com/glygen-glycan-data/GNOme/master/GNOme.browser.html)
Use the GNOme Glycan Structure Browser to find glycan structures by composition, topology, and subsumption relationships.
## [GNOme Composition Browser](https://raw.githack.com/glygen-glycan-data/GNOme/master/GNOme.compositionselector.html)
Use the GNOme Glycan Composition Browser to find glycan compositions by composition and subsumption relationships.

## Topology/Composition Selection Tool
### Change monosaccharide configuration
1. Click on left or right arrow to add or substract a corresponding monosaccharide.
2. Also, there is a keyboard shortcut to add monosaccharide.
<br>a. n for adding GlcNAc
<br>b. m for adding Man
<br>c. g for adding Gal
<br>d. f for adding Fuc
<br>e. s for adding NeuAc
3. Use shift+shortcut/uppercase to substract.
4. Grey Xxx stand for unclassified monosaccharide.
### See detailed subsumption relationship for composition/topology
Simply clicked on the glycan images on the right to go to subsumption navigator.
### Quick help
Simply clicked on the badge with question mark on top right.
### Example

## Subsumption Navigator
### Browsing
1. Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out.
2. Double click on glycan image to change focus.
3. Right click to see external resources about choosing glycan.
### Go back to Topology/Composition Selection Tool
Simply click on "Composition Browser" on top left.
### Ellipsis
The ellipsis on the right hand side indicate there are more glycans are subsumed. The number below it indicate how many glycans were subsumed.
